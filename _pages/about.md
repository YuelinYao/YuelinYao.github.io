❤️ Hello! I am Yuelin. I am pursuing a PhD at the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics), University of Edinburgh, and [MRC Human Genetics Unit](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit), Institute of Genetics and Cancer, where I am supervised by [Ava Khamseh](https://edbiomed.ai/people/) (primary), [Chris Ponting](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/chris-ponting) and [Luke Boulter](https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/luke-boulter). 

🧬 💻 My research focus is applying computational and statistical techniques to investigate molecular mechanisms underlying disease initiation and progression with scRNA-seq data. I have experience in estimating mutational interactions across pan-cancer using a model-free approach with the whole genome sequencing data. Areas of interest also include comparative transcriptomics and population genomics 👫 🐂 🐖. 

🏓 🏃‍♀️ 🎵 🎤 🎨 ✈️ 🦋 🥖 🎲 📸 📖 🎬 🍿 When I am not in the lab, I enjoy doing sports, drawing, traveling, baking... A few of those are listed in Blog.

Feel free to get in touch if you want to learn more about me! ☕️ 😃
