excerpt: 'We deleted Wdr35 from adult bile ducts, which caused these cells to lose primary cilia, an important sensory organelle that normally
senses the environment within bile duct. A year after Wdr35 deletion, bile ducts dilated and formed polycystic liver disease. We used scRNA-seq to identify the transcriptional difference between case and control.'
